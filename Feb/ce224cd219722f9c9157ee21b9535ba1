When opportunities don’t come knocking … Oudtshoorn and De Rust Tourism go and find them. While Oudtshoorn and De Rust Tourism and its members anxiously await the return of tourists, they do their best to ride out one of the quietest travel periods in history. To encourage this, the tourism office invited and hosted eight travel agents from Cape Town and two media representatives this past week. Corleen Barnard, Tourism Manager, spent three days showcasing the wonderful and varied offerings of the region while the visitors enjoyed the yummy eats and treats along way – with the goal of staying top-of-mind when business returns to “normal”. Travel agents and the media were blown away by the diverse offerings of the Oudtshoorn and De Rust area, Barnard says. This included domestic and budget-friendly travel. “The visit  was an enormous success due to the incredible synergy between the tourism office and its members.”
