THE lack of soup kitchens to feed the poor in the GG Camp and Black Joint informal settlements in Oudtshoorn, has seen many families going to bed hungry, according to residents.With a possible resurgence of the third wave of Covid-19, residents fear that the situation could get even worse without feeding schemes in their areas.Concerned members of the two communities say that two soup kitchens that fed many struggling families have disappeared without notice since the country moved to lower levels.GG Camp and Black Joint are two of many communities in Oudtshoorn troubled by youth unemployment and drug abuse. Many families in these areas survive on pension grants, and now that the government social relief grant has been terminated they believe more families will starve.Speaking from a one bedroom shack in GG Camp, Thumeka Mampofu (86) says a soup kitchen could help feed ng families during these trying times. “We are scared of what will happen in the third wave, many people are unemployed. Soup kitchens could help fight hunger. At the start of the pandemic we had people who cared and provided us with some nutritional meals, but all that is gone and the pandemic is still with us,” she says.“We are a struggling community with many families unemployed due to the pandemic. I feel something should be done to fight hunger while we are fighting the spread of the virus,” she ads.Lionel Douglas, a resident of Black Joint, says; “Because of the platoon system children are not always in school, and that is where they get fed. Feeding schemes will really help fight hunger.“As a community we will welcome anyone who can assist with some form of a meal per day. We are still battling with the virus.” (By Mpumi Kiva)
