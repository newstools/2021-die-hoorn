“IT feels like yesterday that I started working at the municipality and it is by God’s grace that I am still healthy and still able to work at this age,” says BrianWeyers (62), the Oudtshoorn Municipality’s longest serving municipal official with 43 years at the municipality behind him.Weyers, a cleaner supervisor, joined the Oudts­hoorn Municipality as a labourer on 22 June 1978. He was later promoted to a supervisory position within the Municipal Community Services Department.Weyers started working for the municipality at the age of 19 and still has a spring in his step, eagerly reporting for work each day with a smile and a joke in his pocket!When Weyers was asked how he managed to always be positive, he answered: “It is because of my late father. He told me to always have a smile when talking to people. That’s exactly what I did.”By following his father’s advice Weyers became the person he is today, always smiling and ready to take life on.Weyers is planning to retire at the end of this year. “I will miss the officials that made an impact on my life and made it possible for me to enjoy my work every day.”According to Weyers’ colleagues they and other municipal officials’ refer to Weyers as the “Mayor” or the “Municipal Manager” around the offices (tongue in cheek).“The municipality would like to thank Mr Weyers for his service – forty-three years and still going strong. We appreciate and value his time with us,” said the acting municipal manager, Reginald Smit.
