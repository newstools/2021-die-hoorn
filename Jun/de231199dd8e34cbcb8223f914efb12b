THE Oudtshoorn Municipality is currently in a discussion with the national Department of Public Works to evaluate the development of a new government precinct within the Greater Oudtshoorn municipal area.The government precinct will con­sist of the development or re­de­ve­lopment of new and existing buil­dings into one central area, hosting different government departments and services, as part of the town’s Vision 2030 strategy. According to the mayor, Chris Macpherson, this will include space for services such as SARS, environmental, rural development and others currently not functional in Oudtshoorn.“The National Spatial Development Framework defines Oudts­hoorn as a regional anchor, and we are hard at work to make this a reality. Oudtshoorn needs to streng­then its position as the heart of the Klein Karoo and continue to play a leading role in the region,” Mac­pher­son said.The deputy mayor, Gevan Juthe, said the investment will bring economic opportunities during the construction and operational phases. “It’s our wish to facilitate a process in collaboration with government to bring services closer to our people.”The Strategic Services Department of the municipality facilitated the process as part of the National Small Town Generation Strategy. They will do a formal submission to the National Department of Public Works as the next step in the process. A feasibility study will be done by the Department of Public Works to determine different options available to make this project possible.During a discussion on Wednesday 12 May with representatives of the national Department of Public Works the delegation visited different sites.
