WRAPPING up the ceremonial cheque handovers to districts across the province in support of developing the code of netball through the 2023 Netball World Cup Legacy Programme, Minister Anroux Marais presented R300 000 and R1 005 000 to the Central Karoo and Eden districts, respectively, this week.At the ceremonial cheque handover, Marais said; “While the 2023 Netball World Cup will take place over two weeks, its legacy will break down barriers to open more opportunities in the Western Cape for generations to come as we actively grow the code by upgrading netball facilities in each district across the province.“Providing and upgrading key facilities are critical components of sports development in the Western Cape, the greater South Africa and the world at large. Sport facility provisioning and upgrades create an enabling environment for local, district, regional, provincial, national and even international sports events to take place with the aim of developing sporting talent at different levels of participation.“Together with our valued stakeholders, I look forward to promoting accessible participation in sport and recreational activities for all, while optimizing on the legacy projects that the 2023 Netball World Cup will afford.“In this way, the code of netball can flourish in terms of safe mass participation, skills development and talent identification to perform at higher levels of excellence”.
