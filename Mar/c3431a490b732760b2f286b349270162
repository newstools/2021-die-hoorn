FALSE information is doing the rounds in communities in the Greater Oudtshoorn regarding the Sigfox/prepaid wa­ter meters, as well as on social media.Residents are being told that the municipa­lity will charge them a fee of R4 000 to install the Sigfox meters.According to the municipality this is not correct.“Please be aware that the water meters are free of charge for the first installation,” a press statement of the municipality issued on 17 March 2021 reads.
