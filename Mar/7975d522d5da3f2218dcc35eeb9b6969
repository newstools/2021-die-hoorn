Acting judge Nobahle Mangcu-Lockwood has ordered the Kannaland Municipality to desist from proceeding with the signing of a R735 mllion electricity and water outsourcing deal as well as making six new political staff appointments. The Minister of Local Government, Environmental Affairs and Development Planning, Anton Bredell approached the Western Cape High Court in January in an effort to prevent the newly reconstituted Kannaland council from making these potentially prejudicial and unlawful decisions. Bredell has welcomed the court’s decision. “The provincial department had tried everything to get the council to cooperate but it was to no avail. The council was determined to push ahead leaving us ultimately with no choice but to approach the court. Bredell says given the financial crisis that the Municipality finds itself in, there was no justification for the additional costs to the wage bill that would have undermined a financial recovery plan that is in progress. “The province has been working hard since 2018 – when the council was placed under financial administration – to assist the council to recover financially. We are grateful that the court has agreed with the province’s position in this matter. The judge stated that the conduct by public officials and political official bearers in Kannaland is harmful not only to the rule of law but to the residents of Kannaland. The judge described the council’s actions as ‘a recipe for chaos in governance’.” The towns of Ladismith, Zoar, Vanwyksdorp and Calitzdorp fall under the Kannaland Municipality that is in the Garden Route district. Bredell has called on the council of Kannaland to work with the department in ensuring the existing financial recovery plan is seen through to the end. “It is in the best interests of the people of Kannaland to see the municipality restored to its full potential.”
