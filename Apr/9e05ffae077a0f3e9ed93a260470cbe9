THE Oudtshoorn Municipality in collaboration with Trapsuutjies Projects as well as the Youth Community Outreach Programme, is currently busy with a cleaning and greening campaign that seeks to involve everyone in the Greater Oudts­hoorn in making a difference.According to a press release from the municipality, the initiative known as #MyTownMyProblem – which started roughly two years ago – encourages residents to look at their environment differently; they can choose a space close to them and beautify it; whether it be by cleaning the area, or planting a few plants and trees.The initiative has gained much attention on social media, reaching a wide audience, with a few residents already becoming involved, tackling dirty sites in their communities, and ensuring they are kept clean.Furthermore, the Municipality is now in talks with different schools, inviting them to join the campaign and create a change.According to the press release Bergsig and De Rust Primary Schools have already joined the initiative. “They are the first two schools in the Greater Oudtshoorn to participate in the cleaning and greening initiative for 2021, and we hope to include more schools soon,” the Municipality said in a press release.The programme for the schools will include a 20 minute awareness and educational session on the importance of the environment and also the impact of illegal dumping. This is followed by a clean-up in and around the school, and greening by planting spekboom.Ambrose Carelse, Municipal environmental health and heritage officer said; “We would like to see more community members get involved. Upload your cleaning efforts in your area on Facebook and let’s start building a culture of #MyTownMyProblem.”
