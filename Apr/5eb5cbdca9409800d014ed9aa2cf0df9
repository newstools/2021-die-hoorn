RESIDENTS of GG Camp, an informal settlement in Bongolethu, continue to be troubled by an un­bea­rable stench of filthy running water in their area. The water, polluted with plastics, bottles, dia­pers, papers and other objects, runs in a trench between the shacks.Recently the community complained of a stench emanating from the waterway, alleging it has not been cleaned by the Oudtshoorn Municipality for a period of three weeks. According to residents attempts to get communal rubbish bins from the municipality has not been successful.The houses closest to the ditch are the most affected by flies and mosquitos.Illegal dumping has become a common sight in Bongolethu. Due to garbage piling up, several dumping sites have been set alight by frustrated residents. Some families have abandoned their homes due to the stench and flies.A resident of the GG Camp, Laura Sam, said the stench of the dirty water and objects thrown into the ditch is a health hazard to children and elderly people.Sam said: “We live with elderly people in our homes who are ill, and sometimes breathing all this dirt from the trench makes them even worse. Some families have abandoned their homes to live with relatives because of this smell. We can’t have a peaceful night’s sleep because of flies and mosquitos.“This dirt has not been collected for some time now and it stinks so much. It’s even difficult to open windows because of the unbearable stench. Children playing in the dirt are beginning to pick up some rashes,” she added.Another resident in the area, Lumko Lathiso, who lives in a shack just a few metres away from the trench, said he does not allow friends and family to visit him because of the dirt and smell.“I can’t host visitors because of the smell and dirt. The municipality must do something about this trench, it’s a health hazard for humans.”A query regarding the matter was sent to the Oudtshoorn Municipality. At the time of going to print no response was received as yet. (By Mpumi Kiva)
