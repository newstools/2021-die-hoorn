ACCORDING to a press release issued by the Oudtshoorn Municipality they have recently been inundated with enquiries from people who require municipal assistance with their municipal accounts which are in arrears.“The incentive scheme (financial aid) which gave relief to rate payers ended on 31 December 2020,” Gerald de Jager, chief financial officer reacted. De Jager, however, assured residents that the municipality is willing to assist residents.“We urge all those who are in arrears on their accounts to contact the municipality via the debt collection section to make arrangements regarding their accounts.”The debt collection unit is situated in the municipal main building in Voortrekker Street and in the Dysselsdorp Municipal Building.“This will prevent people being blocked and disconnected,” De Jager said. “The municipality wants to avoid that people pay reconnection fees during the difficult time of Covid-19 or hand them over to collection attorney firms because we might not be aware of their circumstances.”De Jager urged people who qualify to apply for an indigent subsidy.“The municipality will not be aware of people who have been laid off from work, and therefore asks people to come forward to get help with the burden of not having an income,” De Jager added.The contact details for appointments on accounts arrangements are 044 203 3166/3167/3168/3169/3125 /3025 or send an e-mail to naledi @oudtmun.gov.za, annalize@oudtmun.gov.za, lee-ann@oudtmun.gov. za or nicolene@oudtmun.gov.za.Walk-ins without any appointment will be assisted by the municipality’s debt collection unit as long as all comply with Covid-19 safety requirements.
