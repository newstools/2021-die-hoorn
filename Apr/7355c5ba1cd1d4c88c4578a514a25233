THE ambitions of the SWD Women’s cricket team to qualify for the Super League of the Cricket South Africa provincial women’s competition next season was ruined on Saturday (24 April) when they lost by 79 runs against Easterns.In the promotion qualifier, played at the Wanderers Club, the SWD women, who won the toss and elected to field first did reasonably well to restrict Easterns to 149 all out (in 44,5 overs).It was thanks to a fourth-wicket partnership of 80 between Madison Landsman (48) and Barnadtee Greeff (43) that enabled Easterns to post a competitive total.For SWD Miceala Andrews (3/16 in 8 overs), Jané Winster (3/34 in 10 overs) and Marnizelle Rabie (2/27 in 4,5 overs) excelled with the ball.The SWD batting innings never got going and it was only Winster with an unbeaten 24 that offered some resistance, and SWD was dismissed for only 70.Tsholelolo Marema (3/15), Thambi Mokgohloa (2/19) and Alysia Rudolph (2/1) were the top wicket takers for Easterns.
