RESIDENTS of Newlook and Vaalhuise in Oudts­hoorn have taken it upon themselves to build speed bumps to slow down speeding motorists that race through these areas.Community members said they are fed up with reckless drivers who have no respect for pedestrians and endanger the lives of their children.These self-made speed bumps are becoming a common sight in the streets of Bongolethu and Bridgton in OudtshoornThe bumps are built with soil and some bricks to force traffic to slow down when driving in re-sidential areas.Residents said that in one incident a car nearly destroyed a house after the driver drove into the pavement, hitting the concrete wall around a family’s yard.They also claimed that two dogs were killed two months ago in one week in the same street by a speeding driver. Attempts to get the town council to erect speed bumps in their neighbourhood have not been successful so far.40-year-old Dion Swart of Newlook said speeding cars are a serious concern for many families in 22nd Avenue.“I can’t just sit and do nothing, because speed kills. I am scared because these reckless drivers can drive straight into my house, killing me and my grandson. It’s for a good reason that we have built these bumps in our streets.“Since building this bump I have watched dri­vers slowing down and this is what we want.“Drive carefully and respect the children and our houses,” he said.Another resident, Nontombi Gwadeni, who lives in the Khanya Street in Vaalhuise said: “We see the municipality doing some work, patching the roads, but no speed bumps. We also want them to build bumps in our areas because we are being bullied by motorists who just drive at a high speed. The only way to stop these reckless drivers is by putting bumps on our roads.”The Oudtshoorn Municipality has recently in March upgraded and rehabilitated streets and sidewalks in the Greater Oudtshoorn. The rehabilitation comprised of patching and curbing, but did not include the building of speed bumps. (By Mpumi Kiva)
